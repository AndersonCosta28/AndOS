# INTRODUCTION
#### Observing the shift of technologies from the desktop world to the web, it’s evident that there are very few projects that combine both front-end and back-end development to replicate the functionality of an operating system using a high-level language. This project aims to mimic the operation of an operating system at a high level. We don’t reimplement drivers, kernels, or low-level memory access (at least not yet), but instead delegate these responsibilities to the user’s chosen web browser.
